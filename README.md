# The-Role-of-Arctic-Sea-Ice-in-Climate-Change
Code used to prepare datasets and to evaluate the evolution of sea ice in the Arctic and its impacts on precipitation and temperature.

The various notebooks and codes were used at different steps:

1. Preperation of Data for Analysis 
   Data files from the CMIP6 data base were concatenated merged (for the model mean) to obtain 2000 - 2100 monthly outputs for tas, ta(850), pr and prsn. 
   A different code was used to prepare the sithick and siconc variables as these variables had to be converted from 2D arrays to 1D arrays for analysis.
